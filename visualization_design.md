# Visualization 1: Volatility Calendar Heatmap
  The heatmap visualization displays monthly volatility using the high-to-low price spread as the metric, with months on the x-axis, years on the y-axis, and a color scale ranging from dark blue (low volatility) to red (high volatility). A dropdown menu allows viewers to focus on a single stock at a time, making the interaction more targeted and reducing visual clutter. From this visualization, one key insight is that many stocks show improving stability over time, as indicated by the shift toward darker blue tones in recent years. The heatmap also reveals clear connections between volatility and major economic events—for example, most stocks show pronounced red coloring in 2008, reflecting the heightened uncertainty during the financial crisis. Looking ahead, future improvements could include enabling side-by-side comparisons of multiple tickers, adding a year-range filter, and incorporating an animation feature to display how volatility evolves over time.

# Visualization 2: Macroeconomic Factors vs. Tech Stock Performance Plots
  This visualization uses a faceted plot created in Plotly to display and compare the relationship between six different macroeconomic indicators and the tech sector average stock price over time. Each of the six subplots displays a single macroeconomic indicator plotted against the average stock price of all S&P 500 tech companies. To ensure direct comparability, all data on the Y-axis are transformed using min-max normalization, scaling the values to a range between 0 and 100. This design choice, combining a clear time-series comparison across multiple facets with normalization, allows viewers to easily and quickly compare the trends and potential correlations between the Tech Sector Average performance and various economic conditions. Furthermore, hover data is included across all plots to provide detailed, specific information at any point in the time series.

# Visualization 3: Animated Bubble Chart
  This visualization is designed to provide a dynamic, multi-faceted summary of how U.S. tech stocks, grouped by subsector, have evolved over time across key financial metrics. The design utilizes a bubble chart combined with animation, using Plotly's play/pause and slider features, to capture four dimensions of data simultaneously. Specifically, the X-axis uses a logarithmic scale to display total market capitalization which accommodates the large range of values. The Y-axis plots the average stock price weighted by Market Cap to reflect the price impact of larger companies. Volume, a numerical variable representing trading activity, is intuitively mapped to the size of the bubble while the subsector is assigned to the color of the bubble, allowing for quick visual differentiation of the six different tech groups. The animation and hover data further enhance the presentation by adding the dimension of time and enabling detailed exploration of each subsector's performance evolution.

# Visualization 4: Sankey Diagram (Growth, Subsector, Performance)
  This visualization is meant to demonstrate which subsectors attribute to growth the most growth and size of market cap. The width of the lines are the number of companies going from one node to another. Growth is based on the slope of the regression of log returns of each month. Companies with a negative slope are declining, slope under .02 is stable, slope greater than .02 is high growth stocks. Market caps are based on the average of the normalized marketcaps for each month. Companies with a normalized average of less than 0 are low cap, less than .35 are mid cap and else is large cap. 
  
# Visualization 5: Economic Crisis Reactions
  This visualization displays a stacked line chart for the cumulative returns of n number of days from the event. Each line is colored to an interval (in groups of 10) of the top tech companies in the S&P 500. The X-axis is the days from the event start with 0 being the event start date. The Y-axis is the cumulative returns in perent that represents the total gain or loss of an investment over a specific period. Cumulative returns was used because it is best when wanting to find the returns from a central point. There is a dotted red vertical line to show event start date. There is a dropdown to choose from the economic event (Dot Com Bubble, Great Recession, or COVID-19).
