# Visualization 2: Macroeconomic Factors vs. Tech Stock Performance Plots
This visualization uses a faceted plot created in Plotly to display and compare the relationship between six different macroeconomic indicators and the tech sector average stock price over time. Each of the six subplots displays a single macroeconomic indicator plotted against the average stock price of all S&P 500 tech companies. To ensure direct comparability, all data on the Y-axis are transformed using min-max normalization, scaling the values to a range between 0 and 100. This design choice, combining a clear time-series comparison across multiple facets with normalization, allows viewers to easily and quickly compare the trends and potential correlations between the Tech Sector Average performance and various economic conditions. Furthermore, hover data is included across all plots to provide detailed, specific information at any point in the time series.

# Visualization 3: Animated Bubble Chart
This visualization is designed to provide a dynamic, multi-faceted summary of how U.S. tech stocks, grouped by subsector, have evolved over time across key financial metrics. The design utilizes a bubble chart combined with animation, using Plotly's play/pause and slider features, to capture four dimensions of data simultaneously. Specifically, the X-axis uses a logarithmic scale to display total market capitalization which accommodates the large range of values. The Y-axis plots the average stock price weighted by Market Cap to reflect the price impact of larger companies. Volume, a numerical variable representing trading activity, is intuitively mapped to the size of the bubble while the subsector is assigned to the color of the bubble, allowing for quick visual differentiation of the six different tech groups. The animation and hover data further enhance the presentation by adding the dimension of time and enabling detailed exploration of each subsector's performance evolution.
